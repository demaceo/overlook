## Overview & Learning Goals ::
For this Mod2 solo project, Hotel OverLook, I was given  a WebKit-Starter-Kit repository to work from. The intended goal was to create an application with operational functionality according to the [rubric](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/overlook.html) and provided composition.
My goal for this project was to get more hands-on experience with how to fetch API data as well as how to then access that data in various ways.
